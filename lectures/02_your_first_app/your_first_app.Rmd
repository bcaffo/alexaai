## Creating your first app
- In this lecture, you'll create your first app
- We'll be creating a *custom skill* using Amazon's
Alexa Voice Service and Lambda
- Make sure that you have an account on the Alexa Skills Developer Portal
- Since we'll be using the Lambda free tier, this won't
cost anything for development

## Hello world
- The first step will be to do Amazon's recommended "Hello World" app
- This uses node.js, but don't worry if you don't know it, we're just
going to be copy and pasting.
- The github repo for the example is at 

[https://github.com/alexa/skill-sample-nodejs-hello-world](https://github.com/alexa/skill-sample-nodejs-hello-world)

- You can clone the repo, or just copy and paste code from there

## Sign into the Amazon developer portal
- I often forget the url, google searching for "Alexa Skills Developer Console" it's the first hit
- [https://developer.amazon.com/home.html](https://developer.amazon.com/home.html)
- Make sure that you're signed in (upper right)
- Click on Alexa

## Click on "Alexa Skills Kit"

## Add a new skill

## Make sure "Custom Interaction Model" is checked

## Fill in the fields
- Name your app (say `Hello World`)
- Invocation name (say `Hello World`) again
  - Alexa will invoke the skill with "Alexa open Hello World"
- Audio player directives? No
- Click `Save` then `Next`

## The interaction model
- Amazon has launched a new interface called the "Skill Builder". Since this is still in beta, we'll do it using the existing interface. However, the Skill Builder is pretty cool, so give it a try on a next app.
- First we need to add some `intents`. From Amazon

*"An intent represents an action that fulfills a userâ€™s spoken request. Intents can optionally have arguments called slots."*

- I think of intents as variable names for interactions with Alexa

## My intent schema

```
{
  "intents" : [
    {
      "intent" : "sayHelloWord"
    },
    {
      "intent" : "AMAZON.HelpIntent"
    },
    {
      "intent" : "AMAZON.StopIntent"
    },
    {
      "intent" : "AMAZON.CancelIntent"
    }
  ]
}
```
